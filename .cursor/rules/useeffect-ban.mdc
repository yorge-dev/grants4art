Do not use useEffect anywhere in the codebase. Instead, use more specialized, declarative alternatives:

1. **Data Fetching**: Use React Server Components, Server Actions, or fetch in event handlers/callbacks rather than useEffect
2. **Event Listeners**: Attach listeners directly in event handlers or use ref callbacks
3. **Cleanup/Timeouts**: Handle cleanup in the same event handler that creates them, or use refs with cleanup functions
4. **Derived State**: Use useMemo, useCallback, or computed values in render instead of syncing state in useEffect
5. **Mount-only Logic**: Initialize values directly in render or use callbacks/event handlers
6. **Prop/State Sync**: Use controlled components pattern or derive values directly in render

For Next.js specifically:
- Use Server Components for data fetching when possible
- Use Server Actions for mutations
- Use event handlers for user interactions
- Use refs for DOM access and cleanup
- Derive state from props/state directly rather than syncing in effects

If you encounter a case where useEffect seems necessary, refactor to use one of the above patterns instead.
